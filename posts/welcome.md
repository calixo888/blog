Welcome to my journal! Though a lot of other people like to make blogs, I want to be as transparent as I can here, and really just write about whatever's on my mind or anything that I'd like to share.

I'm all about credibility and integrity, so I don't give advice on things that I'm no expert on, so definitely expect a lot of referrals and shoutouts to others that are super talented at what they do!

Hope you enjoy!
